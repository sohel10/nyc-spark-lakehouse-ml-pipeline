## 📌 Project Overview

NYC Yellow Taxi data is published in monthly parquet files across multiple years.  
Although already in parquet format, the schema evolves over time and requires harmonization for large-scale analytical processing.

This project implements a **production-style lakehouse architecture**:

- Handles schema drift across years
- Resolves datatype inconsistencies
- Avoids Spark memory crashes during ingestion
- Controls partitioning to optimize file sizes
- Builds a partitioned analytical dataset for ML workloads

## 🏗️ Architecture
## 🏗 Architecture Overview

This project implements a production-style lakehouse architecture for scalable multi-year data ingestion and analytical dataset preparation.

## ⚙ Example Execution

Below shows a diagran ingestion and merge process executed with PySpark:

![Spark Pipeline](docs/pipeline.png)


Each layer isolates responsibilities:
- Raw ingestion
- Schema harmonization
- Partition optimization
- Analytical dataset construction

## 📊 Dataset Scale

The pipeline processes large-scale NYC Yellow Taxi trip data:

- **17,089,605 records** ingested and harmonized
- Year-level standardized parquet dataset
- Optimized across **72 Spark partitions**
- Partition-aware dataset design for distributed execution
- Structured for scalable analytical and ML-ready workflows

## ⚙ Example Execution

Below shows a successful yearly ingestion and merge process executed with PySpark:

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

To ensure scalability across multi-year data:

- Avoided full-year in-memory unions
- Streamed ingestion at month-level
- Used controlled `repartition()` strategy
- Designed partitioned write layer for pruning
- Prevented small-file explosion problem
- Minimized Spark shuffle operations
---

## 🔄 Schema Evolution Handling

NYC taxi parquet schemas evolve across years.

Key solutions implemented:

- Used `unionByName(allowMissingColumns=True)`
- Standardized numeric casting across years
- Resolved physical/logical parquet type mismatches
- Explicit column alignment before union
